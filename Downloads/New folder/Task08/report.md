# Lab 01 Report

During this lab, I learned how to initialize a Git repository and create different files.  
I practiced adding, committing, and pushing changes to GitHub.  
I also worked with .gitignore, LICENSE files, and learned how to track and remove files.  
One of the most important parts was creating branches and merging them, which helped me understand collaboration in projects.  
Overall, this lab gave me confidence in using Git and GitHub for version control.
